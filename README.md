This project contains a sample code project that we did for a Genomic partner in Finland

You have two sample codes here, one coming from the sample getting started slightly modified & the second being just adapted for the partner, basically it will allow you to create your pool & connect to your nodes as this is mandatory if you want to be able to see if your startup task script is being correctly deployed or not.
